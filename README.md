This is my example/version of legendary game Breakout made with Sprite Kit. :)

I wanted to show how simple but powerful Sprite Kit is.
Here is [Sprite Kit programming guide](https://developer.apple.com/Library/ios/documentation/GraphicsAnimation/Conceptual/SpriteKit_PG/Introduction/Introduction.html "sprite kit") if you want to start making games with Sprite Kit.

## Gameplay

Just drag your finger on screen to move the paddle to bounce the ball. :)
Tap the replay button if you want to restart the game.

## Customize

You can easily change parameters like
* customize ball direction when ball has contact with the paddle
* ball size
* paddle size
* ball velocity
* speed-up multiplier
* etc.

## Screenshots

Here are two screenshots but you can also check out video :)

## Video

The easiest way to show you how the game looks is to show you a video of it in action :)
But you can also run the app in Xcode and see it yourself
